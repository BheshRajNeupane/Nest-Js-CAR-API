## Project Overview: Ongoing Project

This project marks a transition into Nest JS with TypeORM, departing from previous experiences with Express JS and MongoDB. The primary objective revolves around creating a robust system for vehicle management, valuation, and reporting, incorporating authentication and authorization mechanisms for enhanced security.

### Key Features:

1. **Vehicle Information Input:**
   - Users can input details about their vehicles, including model, year, mileage, price, longitude, and latitude, enabling comprehensive reporting and valuation.

2. **Reporting and Valuation:**
   - Users have the capability to generate reports and assess the value of their vehicles based on the provided information.

3. **Authentication and Authorization:**
   - A complete authentication and authorization system ensures secure access to the platform, safeguarding user data and functionalities.

4. **Administrative Control:**
   - Administrators hold the authority to review and manage submitted reports, allowing them to accept or reject reports as necessary.

### Technologies Utilized:

- **Nest JS:** Leveraged for building scalable and maintainable server-side applications.
- **TypeORM:** Employed for Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) to facilitate database interactions.
- **SQLite DB (Initially) and PostgreSQL (Eventually):** Chosen as the database solutions to accommodate varying project stages and requirements.

### Roadmap:

- **Development Progress:** Continuously evolving towards project completion, with a focus on meeting the impending deadline.
- **Migration to PostgreSQL:** Scheduled for the latter stages of the project to enhance scalability and robustness.

### Conclusion:

The Nest JS project with TypeORM represents an exciting new chapter in the realm of server-side development, offering a powerful foundation for building sophisticated and feature-rich applications. With ongoing development efforts and a clear roadmap in place, the project is poised to deliver a comprehensive solution for vehicle management and valuation within the specified timeframe.
